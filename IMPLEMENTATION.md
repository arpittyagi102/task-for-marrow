# Implementation Details

## Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern, full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript stack:

### Frontend

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with built-in routing, server components, and API routes
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For utility-first styling
- **Radix UI** - For accessible, unstyled UI components
- **React Hot Toast** - For toast notifications
- **React Icons** - For icon components
- **Next Themes** - For dark/light mode support

### Backend

- **Next.js API Routes** - For server-side API endpoints
- **MongoDB** - As the primary database
- **MongoDB Node.js Driver** - For database operations

### Development Tools

- **ESLint** - For code linting
- **PostCSS** - For CSS processing
- **TypeScript** - For static type checking

## Running the Application

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Node.js (v18 or higher)
   - MongoDB instance (local or remote)

2. **Installation**

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. **Development**

   ```bash
   # Run the development server
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Production**

   ```bash
   # Build the application
   npm run build

   # Start the production server
   npm start
   ```

## Design Decisions & Assumptions

1. **Architecture**

   - Used Next.js App Router for better performance and SEO
   - Implemented server components where possible for improved performance
   - Separated concerns into components, lib, and types directories
   - Used MongoDB for flexible document storage

2. **UI/UX**

   - Implemented responsive design using Tailwind CSS
   - Added dark/light mode support for better user experience
   - Used Radix UI components for accessibility
   - Implemented toast notifications for user feedback

3. **Security**

   - Environment variables for sensitive data
   - Server-side validation for API routes
   - Type safety with TypeScript

4. **Performance**
   - Server components for reduced client-side JavaScript
   - Optimized images and assets
   - Efficient database queries

## Additional Features & Improvements

1. **Enhanced User Experience**

   - Dark/light mode toggle
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Loading states and error handling

2. **Developer Experience**

   - TypeScript for better code maintainability
   - ESLint configuration for code quality
   - Organized project structure
   - Component-based architecture

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Add more comprehensive error handling
   - Implement user authentication
   - Add analytics and monitoring
   - Implement rate limiting for API routes
   - Add more comprehensive documentation
